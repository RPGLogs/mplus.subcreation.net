<i>lb_ci = The average of a per dungeon lower bound of a 95% confidence interval of the average <a href="https://support.raider.io/kb/frequently-asked-questions/what-is-the-base-score-value-for-each-level-keystone">raider.io score</a> for each spec, based on the top 100 runs for each dungeon, across all regions, for each set of affixes. For affixes, higher scores indicates affixes are relatively easier. (Other factors, e.g. gear acquisition, particularly early in a season, may also contribute to relative difficulty).</i>
